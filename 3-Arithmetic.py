## Libraries
# We are importing two libraries. Libraries are a set of 
# pre-written code that you can use to speed up your 
# coding time. We'll be using these later in this file.

# import math
# import numpy


## Arithmetic and Operators

# So in the first lesson, we learned about the print 
# function, and that you need to use it to see the 
# output of your code. That's not entirely true, 
# though. You can go to the shell and type in 
# "python3" and enter your code there and it will 
# display as well. For most situations, unless your 
# doing a quick calculation, you'll probably want to 
# have your code in a file and then executed.

# Addition  

# print(1 + 2)
# 
# # Subtraction
# 
# print(3 - 2)
# 
# # Multiplication
# 
# print(3 * 2)
# 
# # Division
# 
# print(3 / 2)

# Exponents

# print(3 ** 2)

# Modulus

# print(15 % 4)

# Floor Division
# Floor division is the same as division, but it drops the decimal. It's the same as math.floor()

# print(15 // 4)
 
# Order of Operations
# Python follows the order of operations.

# print(2 + 3 * 4)

# The math library is a collection of useful mathematical 
# functions. The same is true for the numpy library. 
# NumPy is used more in scientific computing. I believe 
# NumPy has everyting the math library, plus more. NumPy 
# is a 3rd party library, though, and the math library 
# comes with Python.

# You will need to download and install the numpy module 
# in order for this code to work. To do that, click on
# the terminal and type in "pip install numpy". If you 
# do that and it still doesn't work, try doing it this 
# way: ~\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe -m pip install numpy

# print(math.sqrt(4))
# print(numpy.sqrt(4))
# 
# print(math.pi)
# 
# print(numpy.add(3, 3))
