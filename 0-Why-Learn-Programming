1. You can include computer science elements in your lessons, even if you don't teach a CS class. So, for literacy, you could do a choose your own adventure story where students can pick what they want to do in the story. 

You could also assign an internet quiz, make popular by BuzzFeed in the 2010's or like the Hogwart's House Sorting Quiz. Students need to use good grammar, punctuation, and spelling or it's counted off in the assignment.
