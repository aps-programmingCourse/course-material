Why should teachers learn to program?

1. You can include computer science elements in your lessons, even if you don't teach a CS class. 

So, for literacy, you could do a choose your own adventure story where students can pick what they want to do in the story. You could also assign an internet quiz, make popular by BuzzFeed in the 2010's or like the Hogwart's House Sorting Hat Quiz. Students need to use good grammar, punctuation, and spelling or it's counted off in the assignment. 

For math class, you could study the Fibonacci sequence and write a program that calculates and prints the Fibonacci sequence, or show how to do math in code. You can also calculate prime numbers. 

Social Studies could do an interactive website with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

2. Thinking programmatically is benecial not only for learning to code, but it can develop problem-solving skills. This is helpful for adults as well as students. 

3. As you go along, you may find things in your position that you feel might be able to automated. This is particularly true for repetitive tasks. Once you've learned how to code, you might see opportunities to automate. One example might be a random name selector that cycles through a list of student names so you make sure to call on every student in your class. 


There are more reasons to learn to code, but these are just a few examples. If you'd like to collaborate on how to include computer science in your classroom, I'd be more than happy to assist.
