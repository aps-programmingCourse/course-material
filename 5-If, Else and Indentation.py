# import random

## If/Else Statements and Indentation
# Python uses indentation to determine a block of code. If you don't indent, Python will give you an error.

# x = 10

# if x > 5:
#     print("x is greater than 5")
# elif x == 5:
#     print("x is equal to 5")
# else:
#     print("x is less than 5")

# drinks = ["coffee", "tea", "water", "juice", "soda"]

# if "coffee" in drinks:
#     print("Yay!")
# else:
#     print("How sad")

## Random Library
# python has a built-in library called random that can be used to make random numbers
# print(random.randrange(1, 10))

# food = ["pizza", "burger", "fries", "salad", "sushi"]
# print(random.choice(food))

## Project

# Welcome to the first project. We will be building on this project this and next lesson.

# Create a program that plays rock, paper, scissors with the user. Please create a new file, upload it to Google Drive, and share the link with me. 

# Hint: Create a list of the three options and use ramdom.choice() to randomly choose on of the options. Then use if statements to compare the user's choice to the computer's choice and determine the winner.
# Some things you will need: 
#   You will need to use the random library
#   You will need to use the input() function to get the user's choice
#   You will need to use the print() function to show the user what is going on with your program.
